# NprCliNewsReader

This Gem allows a user to choose from a list of news categories. The ClI then displays the articles from npr.org that are under the selected category. Then the user can select a specific article. Once an article is selected then the full article will be displayed. Once the user gets to the end of the article they have a choice to exit the program, return to the category selection, or return back to the article selection from the previous category selected.
